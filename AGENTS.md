## Product boundary

OMP Session Gateway is a secure, local-first directory and capability broker for the browser
collaboration pages of currently running interactive Oh My Pi (OMP) processes. Two paths share the
code; know which one you are changing.

**Upstream generic path** (standalone discovery, `tailscale-serve`):

- Reuse OMP's existing `packages/collab-web` client and wire protocol.
- The PWA lists sessions and launches that client; it does not render or mutate transcripts.
- Consume mainline OMP’s discovery/query contract; keep gateway changes independent of OMP internals.
- Do not add terminal injection, terminal or PTY scraping, QR decoding, clipboard monitoring,
  process-memory inspection, or saved-session-file scraping.

**Private flosrn fleet path** (`cloudflare-access` + `federation`, ADR-033, ADR-034): Flo
authorized a wider boundary for this fork only. The Gateway may additionally show HarnessOS
activity/workspace annotations and relay the workspace RPC (`POST /api/v1/workspace`): Orca
inventory, search, history, read-only saved transcripts, and send/create/resume/set/sleep/close.

- The Gateway itself still reads no session file, scrapes no terminal, and injects no input. It
  only relays a strictly validated request to the HarnessOS bridge socket.
- HarnessOS executes each operation through official Orca CLI commands or its narrow runtime RPCs
  (fixed argv, never a shell built from client text) on an inventory-allowlisted host.
- Keep this path out of the standalone build's behavior: without `federation` the route answers
  `503 unavailable` and no annotation appears.

Both paths: do not claim affiliation with or endorsement by OMP, and do not reuse OMP artwork
without permission.

## Sources of truth

Read the documents governing the subsystem before changing it:

- architecture or trust boundaries: `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
  `docs/SECURITY.md`;
- IPC or HTTP contracts: `docs/PROTOCOL.md`;
- OMP integration: `docs/OMP_INTEGRATION.md` and `UPSTREAM.lock.json`;
- release claims: `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`, `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`, and
  `docs/RELEASE_STATUS.md`.

`UPSTREAM.lock.json` is the exact current OMP baseline. Inspect that source rather than relying on
an older prose snapshot. Update the lock, compatibility data, integration notes, and accepted decisions
together when the baseline or design changes. Keep `bun run check` green.

## Product names

- Product and repository: **OMP Session Gateway** / `omp-session-gateway`
- Management CLI: `omp-gateway`
- Daemon: `omp-gatewayd`
- Optional foreground alias: `omp-gateway serve`
- Service identifier: `omp-session-gateway`
- PWA name: **OMP Sessions**
- Default example tailnet tag: `tag:omp-session-gateway`

## Architecture and security invariants

### Network and IPC

- Production HTTP listeners bind only to `127.0.0.1` and optionally `::1`.
- Tailscale Serve over tailnet HTTPS is the supported remote path. Do not configure or document
  Tailscale Funnel as a normal path.
- Trust Tailscale identity headers only on the loopback backend behind Serve. Production rejects
  missing identity and compares normalized `Tailscale-User-Login` against an exact allowlist.
- Development auth may allow loopback clients without Tailscale, but must reject non-loopback
  sources.
- Require stock mainline OMP `>= 18.1.20`; the controller and local registry shipped in
  PR #11908 (`4999b98bd5`), carried by `v18.1.20`.
- The gateway only reads OMP’s private discovery directory and queries each host’s published endpoint.
  Never write, rename, or unlink discovery files or sockets; never derive the endpoint from a filename.
- Per-host discovery tokens authorize queries to OMP; the gateway’s private readiness token proves
  managed loopback readiness to its CLI and is never an OMP credential.
- The registry is metadata-only and memory-only. A daemon restart begins empty; polling repopulates it.
- Keep metadata records structurally separate from transient launch responses.

### Capabilities

View and Control links are bearer secrets. They may exist only in:

- the live OMP process;
- authenticated per-host query and launch request memory;
- one no-store launch response; and
- volatile collaboration-client JavaScript memory.

They must never enter files, databases, ordinary logs, diagnostics, tracing, metrics, crash reports,
URLs, redirect locations, cookies, browser storage, service-worker caches, analytics, third-party
assets, screenshots, recordings, issue fixtures, or CI artifacts. JavaScript strings cannot be
reliably zeroized; minimize their lifetime and references instead of claiming zeroization.

Session-list and SSE responses carry no capability. On the private path they also carry
activity/workspace annotations (last-entry preview, intent, workspace path) — signed-in owner
metadata, never a capability, and never rendered as a path or identity. Fetch a capability only
after an explicit View or Control action. Launch requests include the expected generation; stale
cards fail rather than receiving a newer capability. Transfer capabilities to the same-origin
pinned client in memory. The gateway fetches each capability from OMP at launch time and never
stores or caches it, even in the registry. Workspace replies, including saved transcripts, live
only in page memory. Browser storage holds only cosmetic preferences, device-local triage records,
and the metadata-only resume selection — never a capability, bearer, or transcript.
Gateway log fields are numeric or boolean only; never log strings from host queries or metadata.

### HTTP and browser

- Validate exact `Origin` on state-changing requests and evaluate `Sec-Fetch-Site` defensively.
- Do not use wildcard CORS.
- API and launch responses are `no-store`.
- Set strict CSP, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, frame
  protections, and a narrow Permissions Policy.
- The service worker caches only immutable application-shell assets and bypasses navigation,
  non-GET requests, `/api/`, and collaboration-client bootstrap traffic.
- Keep runtime assets first-party; do not add analytics, remote fonts, third-party scripts, or CDNs.

## OMP integration invariants

Manual collaboration commands and automatic startup share one collaboration controller; never
duplicate `CollabHost` ownership or import unstable private APIs from an external plugin.

The supported settings contract is:

```jsonc
{
  "collab": {
    "autoStart": "off" // "off" | "view" | "control"
  }
}
```

- `off` preserves normal OMP behavior.
- Start only after interactive context and session initialization complete.
- Register only after the collaboration host connects successfully.
- `view` permits View queries; `control` permits View and Control queries.
- Revoke generation N before publishing N+1 whenever the active host or session changes.
- Stop, shutdown, and fatal host failure unregister immediately.
- OMP publication is independent of gateway availability; OMP does not connect to the gateway.
- Preserve `/collab`, `/collab view`, `/collab status`, `/collab stop`, `/join`, and
  `/leave` behavior.

## Reliability and bounds

- `registry.heartbeatSeconds` is the discovery poll interval (default 10 seconds); TTL defaults to
  35 seconds and must exceed twice the interval. Both remain bounded configuration values.
- Expiry uses daemon receipt time from a monotonic clock.
- Only `ENOENT`/`ECONNREFUSED` proves a queried host dead. Timeouts, permission/resource errors,
  and wire errors retain its card until TTL expiry; absence from discovery removes it.
- Poll rounds coalesce, and launches revalidate generation, access, and any attention request identity.
- Bound host entries, records, query and body sizes, SSE queues, titles, and paths.
- Keep the current OMP relay for the supported path. A self-hosted or proxied relay remains
  unsupported until separately threat-modeled and soak-qualified.
- Annotations: a value the host did not observe stays `null` or absent, never an invented zero.
  Orca workspace state never stands in for OMP `busy`/`inputRequired`.
- Workspace writes run at most once per `requestId`: never retry one automatically, and report a
  lost or unreadable reply as `outcome-unknown`, never success. Only the user resends, with the
  identical body and id.
- The private bridge listing and the Gateway parser change together: an older Gateway refuses a
  listing that carries annotations. Deploy and roll back the Gateway pin with its HarnessOS pin.

## Change and release discipline

- Fix the source behavior; do not suppress failures or special-case fixtures.
- Add or update tests for every behavior change, including failure modes and secret non-persistence.
- Use distinctive synthetic secrets and keep capability and identifier leak scans green.
- Exercise the real changed surface before declaring it working.
- Use the Tested / Supported / Qualified vocabulary in `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` (ADR-030). Claim
  support only for platform families whose named CI lanes are green, and qualification only for the
  exact combinations marked qualified in `docs/RELEASE_STATUS.md` and `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`. Never
  present hosted-runner, emulated-device, or smoke evidence as qualification. Upstream
  qualification never transfers to the private fleet path; its evidence stays **Tested** until a
  qualification of its own is recorded.
- Update architecture, protocol, operations, compatibility, security, and changelog material when
  their contracts change. Record accepted architecture changes in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Keep generated assets and unrelated refactors out of integration changes.
- Use Conventional Commits subjects: `type(scope): lowercase imperative description` or
  `type: lowercase imperative description`.

## Domain docs

Read `CONTEXT.md` when product names or path terminology are ambiguous. For the planned domain
return, read `docs/plans/2026-10-03-return-to-omp-shipmate-bot.md` before changing routing.
