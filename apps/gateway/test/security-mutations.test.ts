/**
 * Named mutations over the security predicates, each of which must fail a named test.
 *
 * Coverage says a line executed. It does not say any assertion would notice if that line stopped
 * doing its job, and for this repository's authorization boundary that is the only property worth
 * having. Bun's own coverage cannot supply it either way: its lcov carries no `BRDA` records at all,
 * so there is no branch signal to read, and `FNF`/`FNH` arrive as bare totals with no `FN:`/`FNDA:`
 * attribution. This measures discrimination instead of execution — weaken one specific guard in a
 * copy of the tree, run the test that claims to defend it, and require that test to fail.
 *
 * Deliberately not tree-wide mutation testing, which would be a large persistent control generating
 * mostly noise about code whose failure costs nothing. Every entry below is a guard whose removal
 * costs a remote authentication bypass or a leaked capability, and the list is meant to stay short
 * enough that someone reads it.
 *
 * The vacuity guard matters more than the mutations. If a `find` string stops matching — a refactor,
 * a rename, a reformat — the mutation silently becomes a no-op and the check passes while proving
 * nothing, which is worse than not having it. A pattern that no longer applies is a failure here, not
 * a skip.
