 *

 * secures or verifies five private paths before it can bind its loopback listener, so one process per
 * path consumed more than the whole `install` readiness budget and every install was torn back down
 * (#90). One process answers every request of a run instead.
 *
 * `apply` builds a fresh `DirectorySecurity` or `FileSecurity` holding only the owner and the DACL,
 * and .NET's `SetAccessControl` persists only the sections a security object has changed, so no
 * apply ever writes the SACL. It used to round-trip the path through `Get-Acl`/`Set-Acl`, and
 * `Set-Acl` first tries to write the SACL as well. Without `SeSecurityPrivilege`, which a standard
 * user's token does not hold, it retries without the SACL only when the new descriptor's
 * audit-protection flag equals the target's DACL-protection flag. Once a path's DACL was protected
 * those never matched, so every command after the first failed for a non-elevated user (#293).
 *
 * Paths arrive as JSON data and are never spliced into the script, so a hostile path cannot become
 * code. Each reply carries its request id back, so a failure can only be attributed to the path that
 * produced it. Reply text is squeezed to printable ASCII because a redirected PowerShell writes
 * stdout in the console code page, which would otherwise corrupt the framing.
