 * operator who points a tunnel at the listener turns `Tailscale-User-Login` into attacker-controlled

 * marks that Serve never produces, and a remote caller cannot remove marks the proxy itself adds.
 *
 * Measured against Serve's proxy (`ipn/ipnlocal/serve.go`, `addProxyForwardedHeaders` and
 * `addTailscaleIdentityHeaders`): it sets `X-Forwarded-Host` to the inbound host, sets
 * `X-Forwarded-For` to the single tailnet source address, and deletes every inbound `Tailscale-*`
 * header before setting its own. It never sets `Forwarded`, `X-Real-IP`, or vendor headers.
 *
 * This is defence in depth and not authentication: a raw TCP forwarder inserts no headers at all and
 * remains indistinguishable from Serve. Only an authenticator the gateway can verify closes that.
