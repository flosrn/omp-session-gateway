# Architecture

## 1. Components

### 1.1 Mainline OMP discovery reader

Stock mainline OMP `>= 18.1.20` owns its collaboration controller and per-host local registry.
[PR #11908](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11908), merge `4999b98bd5`, ships in [OMP v18.1.20](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/releases/tag/v18.1.20). No fork, custom OMP build, or gateway-specific OMP plugin is required.
The gateway remains a separate installation: enable `collab.autoStart` once, then start plain
`omp`. Bun 1.4.0 and TUN-mode Tailscale Serve remain deployment prerequisites; see
[OMP_INTEGRATION.md](OMP_INTEGRATION.md).

`OmpHostReader` reads discovery entries under `~/.omp/run/collab-hosts` (or the configured
`omp.discoveryDir`) and queries each entry’s published `endpoint` with its per-host token.
OMP may relocate a long socket path; deriving a socket name from the JSON filename is incorrect.
The gateway never writes, renames, or unlinks anything in the discovery directory.

Snapshot queries return metadata only. OMP owns publication and cleanup, independently of the
gateway. The file shape and one-request-per-connection wire contract are in [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

### 1.2 Host poller and launch broker

`startHostPoller` coalesces concurrent polls, reads host snapshots, and reconciles the metadata-only
`SessionRegistry`. `registry.heartbeatSeconds` is the poll interval (default 10 seconds), not a
publisher heartbeat. Hosts absent from discovery or conclusively dead are removed; transient query
failures retain an existing card until `registry.ttlSeconds` (default 35 seconds) expires. Only
`ENOENT`/`ECONNREFUSED` proves a queried host finished; a timeout, `EMFILE`, `EACCES`, or wire
error such as `snapshot_unavailable` must not retire it immediately.

`OmpLaunchResolver` is the launch broker. After the HTTP authorization checks, it verifies the
observed generation, requested access, and optional attention request identity; queries OMP for a
`link` for that exact generation and access; and revalidates before returning a capability.
`mode_unavailable` refuses a role no longer shared.

The gateway fetches capabilities **only per explicit launch**. It never stores or caches them,
including in the registry: their gateway lifetime is confined to the query and no-store launch
response. This is strictly narrower than the fork-era in-memory secret store, which retained links
for the lifetime of a published session.

### 1.3 `omp-gatewayd`

A per-user daemon is the sole aggregator and remote authorization point.

Responsibilities:

- read OMP discovery and query per-host endpoints;
- maintain an in-memory metadata registry with process/session generations and freshness TTLs;
- expose a loopback-only HTTP server and static PWA;
- authorize requests using Tailscale Serve identity plus an application allowlist;
- return a single capability only after an explicit View or Control action;
- stream metadata-only updates with SSE;
- start at desktop login and recover cleanly from restart;
- embed or serve a pinned build/integration of OMP's existing `collab-web` client;
- persist private VAPID/subscription material separately from the memory-only session registry and send metadata-only Web Push attention/resolution envelopes;
- provide `install`, `status`, `doctor`, token rotation, and `uninstall` through `omp-gateway`.

The registry is intentionally empty after daemon restart. The next host poll repopulates it; no capability store exists.

### Private flosrn fleet variant

With `federation` configured, the daemon replaces standalone OMP discovery with the HarnessOS
fleet directory and Control broker. It talks to a private gateway-only Unix socket with a separate
bearer token, never the Hub's owner/admin socket. The bridge exposes only `GET /gateway/sessions`,
`POST /gateway/open` and `POST /gateway/workspace`; it grants no Hub role or administration.

The registry stays metadata-only and memory-only. A fleet card's `instanceId` is lowercase
SHA-256 of `host + "\0" + originalInstanceId`, not a capability. Host summaries include empty,
stale and never-read machines. A failed bridge poll retains cards as unavailable rather than
pretending their sessions ended. Control launches check identity, generation, availability,
freshness and any attention request before and after the bridge request; View is refused.

The fork's `cloudflare-access` mode uses a loopback Cloudflare Tunnel origin and independently
verifies a pinned Access application JWT. It never falls back to Serve headers. Browser mutations
still require the exact public origin. Standalone `tailscale-serve` retains its existing invariants.
The PWA remembers only a versioned instance/generation/mode selection for reload and foreground
resume, then obtains a fresh capability through the normal broker. Push uses the same host-qualified
metadata identity; unavailable cards produce neither attention nor activity-stop notifications.
A fleet card has no View, so an activity-stop tap opens Control for the same generation.

**Activity directory.** Each fleet card may carry HarnessOS `activity` (last entry time, tool,
intent, one-line preview, context tokens/window, cumulative cost, subagent count) and an Orca
`workspace` (branch, comment, status, unread, PR). HarnessOS reads them from the host's own
session files and Orca, never the Gateway; field meanings are in
[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md#private-fleet-annotations). The registry treats a change in either as a
revision. The directory lists working sessions Working first, then by `activity.at` (else
`startedAt`), grouped by project or machine with collapsible groups. A missing fact is omitted,
never drawn as zero; tool and intent show only while busy; a stale machine's facts read "Last
known". Workspace `id`/`path` and session identities never reach visible text.

**Workspace panel.** A panel beside the directory runs the workspace RPC on one authorized
machine at a time: Orca workspaces and terminals (state, preview, send), search, past-session
history with a read-only transcript and resume, create, and status/comment/sleep/close with
confirmation. Every call is one `POST /api/v1/workspace`; the gateway validates, relays once to
`/gateway/workspace`, and revalidates the reply. HarnessOS queues it for the Mac's operator agent,
which runs it against Orca on the Mac or a paired compute host
([request flow and dedupe](PROTOCOL.md#post-apiv1workspace)).

  Mac -- "orca CLI argv / runtime RPC" --> Orca[(Orca: Mac or paired host)]
  Mac -- "POST /operator/workspace/:id" --> Hub
```

**Badge and turn stop.** The open page sets the installed app badge to the pending-ask count it
can Control, the same rule as Push `pendingAskCount`, and the service worker does the same from
Push; both feature-detect the Badging API and clear it on authorization loss. The registry latches
a turn observed working and carries it across a mid-turn ask, so answering and going idle still
raises one activity stop. A stale or unknown reading, a generation change or a restart clears the
latch rather than raising a stop.

**Authorization loss.** A 401, 403 or Access login redirect on the directory snapshot, SSE,
workspace RPC or the open client's same-origin health probe ends the page's authorization: the
collaboration transport is disposed, the composer disabled, the workspace panel locked, the badge
cleared. Only a fresh sign-in and an explicit launch reconnect. What this does and does not revoke
is in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#private-flosrn-access-and-fleet-boundary).


### 1.4 OMP Sessions PWA

The PWA is a deliberately small session directory and launcher.

Each card may show only non-secret metadata:

- friendly title;
- repository or directory basename, with full paths disabled by default;
- model label when configured;
- process start and last-seen time;
- health/streaming state if available without transcript data;
- boolean response-required state, rendered as **Needs attention**, with an opaque request identity
  and receipt timestamp but no prompt content or answer data;
- **Control** as the primary action when available and permitted; **View** only for standalone
  read-only sessions, and **Open request** for attention requiring Control;
- **Hold for desk** for exact-ask local queue routing; and
- **Hide** for reversible device-local hiding of non-attention rows, presented as a
  compact per-row control with an explicit accessible label.

A directory with zero live sessions shows the `collab.autoStart` empty-state guidance instead of a
zero-count summary. Device-scoped preferences — the background-alert toggle, notification detail,
and build identity — live in one Settings sheet behind a persistent masthead control; the `All
clear` summary claims "You'll get pinged" only while alerts are enabled and otherwise offers the
Settings path.

The PWA never prefetches capabilities. It receives metadata from `GET /api/v1/sessions` and
`GET /api/v1/events`, then requests one capability after an explicit tap.

Couch triage is a device-local presentation layer over that authoritative metadata. **Hold for
desk** stores only the exact `(instanceId, requestId, heldAt)` identity of an ask and skips it in
this device's FIFO rotation; it does not clear gateway attention, reduce the pending count or app
badge, or affect another device. **Hide** is available only on non-attention rows and stores
only `(instanceId, generation, dismissedAt)`; it hides the row on this device, performs no network
mutation, and never stops the OMP process. A five-second Undo and a persistent **Show all** surface
make dismissals reversible. Active-shell Hold commits only after the next launch succeeds; a launch
failure leaves the current ask in rotation and offers retry without unmounting its collaboration
shell.

Authoritative snapshots and upserts remove a held record when its exact ask changes or clears, and
remove a dismissal when the session disappears, its generation changes, or it needs attention.
Transport failures do not erase either record. Optional `busy` distinguishes sampled activity from
idle/unknown, not successful completion. The PWA must not invent a Completed state or label local dismissal
as Close or Exit. These bounded records contain no title, path, model, prompt, answer, transcript,
or collaboration capability.

An explicit Settings-sheet action enables background Web Push. Permission is never requested on load.
The gateway sends strict Push v2 attention/clear and activity-stop envelopes with bounded identity and a
bounded pending count. Private detail uses a fixed title with no body; Session (the default) adds
bounded session/project labels. Preview falls back to Session because stock OMP supplies no ask
preview. Visible text may persist in notification history, screenshots, or wearables. A tap never
navigates an open window: the worker focuses the most recently focused one and posts it the
notification's metadata-only data, and the page revalidates the exact current ask or generation
in place, keeping a collaboration already open at the tapped authority. With no open window, or
none that accepts within three seconds, it opens `/collab/:instanceId?request=:requestId`, which
the app synchronously scrubs before the same revalidation (ADR-017 amendment). Valid taps use the
ordinary generation-bound, no-store, in-memory launch flow; stale taps never launch. Background
delivery remains best effort and outside the v0.4.0 qualified core matrix.

The registry alone detects a turn ending on a continuing identity/generation: a turn observed
working (`busy: true` outside an ask) latches, the latch survives a mid-turn ask (which hides
`busy`), and the first later idle sample (`busy: false`, no ask) raises one stop. An unknown
reading, a retained poll, a replacement or a restart clears the latch without a stop; a waiting
sample never produces one itself. Retained polls remove only activity knowledge without extending
TTL. Its private stop event shares the ordered dispatch queue but is never sent as a browser SSE
event. A record-local revision marker invalidates stale queued delivery across busy, unknown, or
identity transitions. Stop taps use the exact instance/generation route and open View after fresh
metadata (Control on a View-less fleet card). The shared per-instance notification tag and
displayed-attention priority are specified in [ATTENTION_SPEC.md](ATTENTION_SPEC.md).

PWA upgrades activate immediately after the new content-hashed shell is cached. The shell includes
the pinned collaboration-client module and stylesheet, and an idle directory warms the module
import so a launch pays only for its capability request and relay connect; launch-time loading
remains the fallback. Activation retires prior shell caches and claims clients but never navigates
one: Chromium reports a client's creation URL, not the route the page later reached through the
history API, so the worker cannot tell an idle directory from a pending launch or a live `/client/`
collaboration (ADR-018 amendment). The page observes the controller change and reloads itself after
one second only while no launch is pending, no routed notification awaits its snapshot, and no
collaboration client is mounted. Otherwise the update applies when a failed launch returns to the
directory or the user leaves collaboration. The no-store `/update/` bootstrap, which the new
document synchronously scrubs to `/`, remains only for activations by earlier workers.

### 1.5 Existing OMP collaboration client

Reuse a pinned OMP `packages/collab-web` revision. Do not independently implement the transcript, tool cards, subagent controls, relay protocol, or cryptography.

Preferred integration:

1. expose a small upstreamable client bootstrap such as `startWithCapability(capability)` or a component prop;
2. render or mount the client from the same PWA origin;
3. keep the capability in JavaScript memory only;
4. dispose of references when leaving the session;
5. return to the directory on reload because the capability is intentionally not recoverable.

In a writable Control session, the same pinned client may collect up to four photos through the
Photo action's explicit source panel. **Take photo** uses a dedicated file input with
`capture="environment"`; **Choose existing** uses a separate image input without `capture` so
Android never has to infer camera-versus-library intent from one control. It rejects source
dimensions above an 8,192px edge or 20 megapixels, then decodes and canvas-re-encodes JPEG, PNG, or
WebP input in volatile browser memory, stripping
EXIF/location metadata while bounding each normalized JPEG to a 2,048px edge and 1 MiB. The
composer passes an optional note plus those images through OMP's existing encrypted v3
`prompt.images` frame directly to the host, then retains the draft until the host echoes the
corresponding transcript entry. No gateway HTTP endpoint,
registry record, service-worker route, URL, browser-storage record, or new relay protocol is added.
The host and model provider receive the normalized prompt exactly as they would an image attached
locally in OMP; ordinary OMP transcript/provider retention therefore still applies.

A same-origin child window plus `MessageChannel` is acceptable only when the browser preserves a distinct exact-origin opener: open `/client/` synchronously during the tap, fetch the capability in the opener, transfer it with a same-origin `postMessage`, and never put it into a URL or DOM attribute. Installed Android PWA launch must use the preferred same-document mount because Chrome may reuse the standalone window without an opener.

The pinned client uses the in-memory bootstrap. Do not introduce a fragment-based compatibility
path: fragments can remain in browser history before replacement and leak through screenshots or
copied URLs. Reload intentionally returns to the metadata directory.

### 1.6 Relay

**v1:** use OMP's existing encrypted collaboration relay. OMP seals collaboration payloads before the socket, and the gateway does not need to proxy WebSockets.

**Optional hardened mode:** self-host OMP's content-blind relay on the desktop or tailnet. Keep it a separate opt-in deployment and validate long-lived WebSocket behavior, Android sleep/resume, network changes, and reconnects through the exact production proxy path before calling it supported.

## 2. Runtime flow

### 2.1 Desktop login

1. The OS starts `omp-gatewayd` as the current user.
2. The daemon atomically creates or reads its private readiness token for CLI readiness proofs.
3. It starts polling OMP’s discovery directory; no gateway publisher endpoint is created.
4. It binds HTTP to loopback, for example `127.0.0.1:4317`.
5. A persistent Tailscale Serve mapping exposes that loopback server privately over tailnet HTTPS.

### 2.2 OMP process start

1. Interactive OMP finishes creating the active session/context.
2. If `collab.autoStart` is `view` or `control`, OMP’s controller starts collaboration.
3. OMP publishes its discovery file and owner-only per-host query endpoint.
4. The next gateway poll fetches a metadata snapshot and reconciles the process card.
5. A changed registry revision emits metadata-only SSE, and the phone renders the card.

OMP’s snapshot supplies the boolean `inputRequired`, not prompt or response content. Each accepted
false-to-true transition creates one opaque in-memory attention identity and receipt timestamp.
Repeated true observations preserve that identity; false, removal, expiry, and generation
replacement destroy it. The browser receives the boolean plus `ask.requestId` and `ask.since`;
OMP remains unaware of this browser-routing metadata.

### 2.3 Background attention push

1. The user explicitly grants notification permission and subscribes through
   `POST /api/v1/push/subscription`, choosing `private`, `session`, or `preview` detail.
2. The gateway persists only the VAPID key pair, browser endpoint/keys, authenticated identity, and
   detail choice in a private state file.
3. A Control-capable attention transition builds an encrypted `attention` message at the selected
   detail level; clear/removal builds `clear`. Neither contains a capability.
4. The browser push service wakes the installed PWA's service worker even when no page is open.
5. The worker tags one notification per instance, updates the app badge from the bounded pending
   count, and closes that tag on `clear`.
6. Tapping opens `/collab/:instanceId?request=:requestId`; the app fetches current authenticated
   metadata and launches Control only when the exact request identity remains actionable.

### 2.4 View or Control launch

1. The user taps **View** or **Control**.
2. The shipped same-document client marks the launch pending in page memory before loading its assets and requesting a capability. The URL changes to `/client/` only at mount; the ADR-018 reservation gap above remains unresolved.
3. The PWA performs a same-origin `POST /api/v1/sessions/:instanceId/launch` with the observed generation and desired mode.
4. The gateway verifies Tailscale identity, application allowlist, Origin, fetch metadata, content type, rate limits, generation, freshness, and mode availability.
5. The launch broker queries OMP for the exact generation and role, revalidates current state, and
   returns exactly one capability in the no-store response without retaining it.
6. The PWA passes the capability directly to the pinned collab client's in-memory bootstrap, optionally through a same-origin `MessageChannel`.
7. The client connects directly to the relay encoded by OMP's parser.
8. Leaving the client drops capability references and returns to the metadata directory. Reload does not reconnect automatically.

### 2.5 Session switch, resume, or branch

OMP owns host replacement and generation changes. The gateway observes replacement snapshots and
updates the existing process card. A launch carries the generation seen by the browser; OMP’s
`link` operation rejects `stale_generation`, and the broker revalidates after querying. An old
card never silently receives a replacement capability.

### 2.6 Crash and stale cleanup

The daemon records successful observation time using a monotonic clock. A missing discovery entry
or a host query failing with `ENOENT`/`ECONNREFUSED` removes the card. Other query failures retain
an existing card until its TTL expires; the default is a 10-second poll interval and 35-second TTL.
A connection closing after a response is normal: OMP serves one request per connection.

Removal drops metadata before emitting SSE. There is no capability map to clear and no OMP-owned
file or socket for the gateway to delete.

## 3. Trust boundaries

    PHONE <--> RELAY
```

A malicious process running as the same desktop OS user is outside the intended threat boundary; it can generally read the user's files or interfere with OMP directly. OS permissions and per-host query tokens still reduce accidents and cross-user access but are not a sandbox against same-user malware.

A compromised or unlocked phone with valid tailnet identity is also capable of requesting sessions
until the device is revoked. WebAuthn user verification is proposed in ADR-008, not implemented in
v0.4.0; it is not an additional Control gate operators can rely on today.

## 4. Why not process scanning or terminal automation?

Process enumeration can find PIDs but cannot safely attach OMP's browser collaboration protocol to an existing interactive context or recover a capability without reading process memory. Simulated keystrokes, terminal scraping, QR decoding, and clipboard monitoring are fragile and create additional secret channels.

The private fleet path's terminal `send` is not an exception in the Gateway: the Gateway relays a
typed request, and HarnessOS delivers it through Orca's own `terminal send` command with a durable
prompt id, after Orca reports the terminal connected and writable (ADR-034). Nothing scrapes a
terminal or synthesizes keystrokes outside Orca's supported interface.

Mainline OMP exposes the supported discovery/query surface needed here. Consume it rather than
private deep imports, process inspection, or a second collaboration controller.

## 5. Availability behavior

- Gateway unavailable: OMP continues normally and its discovery publication remains independent. The
  visible client measures the same-origin path with adaptive RTT timeouts and identifies a sustained
  outage as `Gateway unavailable` without exposing session data.
- Relay unavailable: cards remain visible. Passive host frames and optional encrypted idle probes
  measure the browser-to-host path; two missed probes replace the socket, each connection handshake
  is bounded to ten seconds, and sustained failure is identified as `Relay unavailable` without
  exposing the capability.
- Tailscale unavailable on the phone: there is no public fallback.
- Desktop asleep or offline: a loaded shell retains the last authenticated metadata in volatile
  memory, marks it stale with a freshness timestamp, and retries. Authorization denial clears it;
  metadata is never an offline capability or a substitute for launch authorization.
- Dashboard SSE silence: after 12 seconds the PWA closes the half-open stream and retries snapshots
  without clearing last-known cards. Current request timeouts and retry bounds are documented in
  [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md#7-revisions-and-races).
- Collaboration client radio transition: browser lifecycle/network signals trigger measurement rather
  than declaring health. Hidden pages cancel relay probes. Foreground gateway recovery requires two
  successful probes and replaces a potentially stale relay socket after the first success.
- Terminal collaboration state: client recovery timers/listeners stop immediately; the ended status
  and return action remain stable and receive no later path-health publications.
- Gateway restart: it starts empty; polling discovers already-published mainline OMP hosts without
  any OMP reconnect or per-session command. Restart a fork-era OMP process under mainline at cutover.
- OMP crash: missing discovery, definitive endpoint failure, or TTL expiry removes the card.
- Browser reload: returns to the directory; capability persistence is intentionally absent.
- Browser background and restore: the collaboration client is disposed and its capability dropped on
  `pagehide`, and the restored page relaunches the same session when the directory still lists it at
  the same generation with the same access, falling back to the directory otherwise (ADR-029). The
  capability is fetched again at resume time, never retained — which is why a reload, whose heap is
  gone, still lands on the directory instead.
- Browser push service unavailable or delivery delayed: the dashboard and collaboration paths continue normally; alerts are best effort and never bypass current-state validation.
