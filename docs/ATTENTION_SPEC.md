# Needs-attention and notification detail contract

Normative implementation contract for the Couch Flow directory, authoritative ask loop, and
per-device background alerts. Read with [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and ADR-019,
ADR-026, and ADR-027 in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md); this document specifies their metadata,
push, and privacy behavior.

## Product boundary

The dashboard is a session directory and capability broker, not a second agent UI. It may display
bounded gateway metadata:

- session and project labels;
- `inputRequired` and optional `busy` activity;
- an opaque request ID and server receipt timestamp;
- an optional bounded request preview and option count.

It never renders a transcript, response option labels, prefills, answers, or collaboration
capabilities. The baseline OMP attention contract supplies only boolean `inputRequired`; newer
hosts additionally report activity `busy`. Neither supplies request content, so preview and option
count remain absent: the hero says `Waiting for your input`, Preview notifications fall back to
Session detail, and Control opens the authoritative ask in the pinned collaboration client.
The gateway polls this metadata and fetches a capability only for an explicit launch; it never
stores links. Activity is optional in browser metadata; stop notifications add one strict Push v2 variant.

## Directory behavior

The home screen has one whole-screen mode:

- any waiting session: `Needs you`, FIFO by `ask.since`, with one `Up next` hero, remaining waiting
  rows under `Then`, and remaining live rows last;
- no waiting sessions and at least one live session: `Sessions`, one `All clear` summary, then
  live rows newest-first;
- no live sessions: the empty state with `collab.autoStart` guidance and no count pill.

The hero action is `Open request` when Control is available and `View transcript` otherwise.
Control-capable heroes also offer `Hold for desk` and `Transcript`. A bounded `ask.preview`
renders as readable sentence-case text with the option count; it is never uppercased. Every
non-hero waiting or non-waiting item is a whole-row button; the working row's trailing compact
`Hide` control keeps the exact device-local dismissal semantics (reversible, no network
effect) with an explicit accessible label. The `All clear` summary repeats the ping promise only
while background alerts are enabled; otherwise it shows a chip that opens Settings. The masthead
has no manual Refresh control; snapshots, SSE, liveness checks, and bounded retry own directory
freshness.

Known activity is shown distinctly from idle or unknown. These labels do not create a Completed
state or imply that an inactive host exited; all live hosts remain selectable.

## Notification control

The Settings sheet control has exactly these labels:

| State | Label | Enabled? |
|---|---|---:|
| checking | `Checking background alerts…` | No |
| idle | `Enable background alerts` | Yes |
| enabling | `Enabling…` | No |
| disabling | `Disabling…` | No |
| enabled | `Disable background alerts` | Yes; disables in place |
| blocked | `Notifications blocked` | No |
| unavailable | `Background alerts unavailable` | No |

The sheet opens from the persistent masthead Settings control. Notification detail options are
visible only while the subscription is enabled.

Permission is requested only from the explicit enable action inside the sheet. A previously
granted subscription may be reconciled on load without prompting.

The settings bottom sheet stores one level with each browser endpoint:

- `private`: fixed title only;
- `session` (default): session/project labels;
- `preview`: session detail plus the bounded ask preview when one exists.

The sheet warns that Preview may persist in notification history, screenshots, and wearables, and
states that payloads are built on the gateway at the selected level. The phone does not receive a
richer payload and redact it locally. Disabling unsubscribes in the browser and removes that
endpoint from the gateway; delivery `404`/`410` also removes stale state.

## Notification lifecycle

The gateway assigns a new opaque request ID and daemon receipt timestamp on each accepted
`false → true` ask transition. Repeated `true` updates preserve that identity. It sends
Control-capable attention only; view-only sessions cannot open a resolving Control client.

An attention payload is strict Push API version 2:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "type": "attention",
  "instanceId": "metadata-only-instance-id",
  "generation": 3,
  "requestId": "opaque-request-identity",
  "pendingAskCount": 2,
  "title": "OMP session needs attention",
  "body": "optional server-built detail"
}
```

`body` is omitted at `private`. The worker uses one replacement tag per `instanceId`, sets the app
badge to `pendingAskCount`, and stores only version, type, instance ID, and request ID in
notification data.

Resolution, removal, or replacement queues a strict clear payload before any replacement ask:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "type": "clear",
  "instanceId": "metadata-only-instance-id",
  "requestId": "opaque-request-identity",
  "pendingAskCount": 1
}
```

A clear closes the notification only when its stored request ID matches, so a delayed clear cannot
close a rearmed ask. Push delivery uses high urgency and a five-minute TTL, and remains best effort.
Messages carry no Web Push `Topic`: FCM treats a topic as a collapse key and throttles collapsible
messages to a burst of 20 per app per device, refilling one every three minutes, so ordinary ask,
clear, and stop traffic would be delayed by minutes. Without a topic, a push service holding
messages for an offline device delivers every unexpired one on reconnect, not only the newest.

## Activity-stop notifications

Newer OMP hosts publish optional `busy` from `session.isStreaming` (upstream PR #12844). True
means a turn is running; false means no turn is currently running. Missing/null is unknown,
not idle. The value may be false during a scheduling pause; it never proves successful completion
or process exit. Older hosts remain visible but cannot produce activity-stop alerts.

The registry raises a stop only when a turn it observed working (`busy: true`, no ask) on the same
continuing generation and immutable host/session identity is next sampled idle (`busy: false`, no
ask). The working latch survives a mid-turn ask, which hides `busy`, so answer-then-idle still
stops; the current sample itself is never waiting. Ask start or resolution wins when it overlaps the
sampled stop. Initial idle, repeated
idle, unknown activity, generation/identity replacement, disappearance, endpoint death, TTL expiry,
and daemon restart never synthesize a stop. Retained/unreadable polls clear only activity knowledge,
without refreshing receipt time, last-seen time, ask state, or TTL; recovery at false cannot alert.

Stop transitions are gateway-internal events, not a new browser SSE event. An in-memory marker on
existing registry records invalidates queued stops across activity, uncertainty, or identity
changes, even if later metadata looks identical. Delivery rechecks that marker and current ask
state. No activity history, transcript, capability, or notification ledger is persisted.

The strict additive Push v2 payload is:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "type": "activity_stop",
  "instanceId": "metadata-only-instance-id",
  "generation": 3,
  "pendingAskCount": 0,
  "title": "OMP session activity stopped",
  "body": "optional server-built session detail"
}
```

Private omits the body. Session uses existing bounded labels; Preview falls back to Session
because a stop has no ask preview. View-only sessions are eligible. Opening the gateway or
creating/renewing a subscription does not replay historical stops.

Stop and attention share the notification tag, five-minute TTL, and ordered delivery queue. A
displayed valid attention notification wins over an incoming stop;
attention replacing a stop requests a fresh alert (`renotify: true`), while duplicate attention
delivery does not re-alert. A delayed request-specific clear cannot close a stop, whose
notification data has no request ID. The badge still counts pending controllable asks, not stops.
Delivery is best effort: brief turns between polls can be missed, and attention priority may
suppress a stop while an earlier attention notification remains displayed. After an offline
period, an ask resolved meanwhile can alert briefly before its queued clear closes it. Push services
do not guarantee order, so a clear that overtakes its attention leaves that attention displayed
until the next ask replaces it or the user dismisses it. Taps still revalidate the exact current
request before acquiring Control.

Older Push v2 workers cannot interpret the new variant and continue to handle attention/clear.
Ignoring an unsupported push is not guaranteed silent: browsers enforcing `userVisibleOnly`
may display their own generic background-update notification. Open or refresh the PWA after
upgrading to activate the current worker before relying on stop alerts. No push-state schema,
opt-in preference, or installed-client qualification changes.

## Notification tap

The worker never navigates an existing window (ADR-017 amendment, 2026-09-30). It focuses the most
recently focused same-origin window and posts it the notification data; a page that accepts
handles the route in place, with the checks below and the ordinary in-place launch. A tap for the
collaboration already open, at the authority the tap grants, keeps it. With no open window, or none
that accepts within three seconds, the worker opens:

`/collab/{instanceId}?request={requestId}`

The app synchronously replaces that routing URL with `/`, loads an authenticated snapshot, and
opens Control only when the same instance still has the exact request ID, `inputRequired: true`,
and `canControl: true`. Otherwise it keeps the directory visible and reports the request as
resolved or changed; during an open collaboration it keeps that collaboration and reports it in the
triage bar unless a triage prompt is already showing. The later launch POST revalidates generation
and returns the collaboration capability through the ordinary no-store, in-memory path.

For a stop, the route is `/collab/{instanceId}?activity=stopped&generation={generation}`.
The app scrubs it before networking, fetches authenticated metadata, and opens **View** only for
the same generation when View remains available. It never upgrades a View-capable tap to Control;
a private-fleet card offers no View, so its tap opens Control for that same generation. A gone,
replaced, or unavailable session leaves the directory visible with an expired/changed notice.
Activity may have resumed after delivery; the tap opens the current transcript, not a claimed
completed result. The ordinary launch endpoint revalidates generation and access again.
Both route variants reject duplicate, mixed, extra, or malformed parameters.

Opaque request IDs are correlation metadata, not bearer authorization. They may occur transiently
in push, notification data, the scrubbed route, and capability-free history state. Collaboration
capabilities remain forbidden from push state/payloads, notifications, URLs, history, service
worker messages, browser storage, caches, logs, and diagnostics.

## Acceptance checklist

The first checklist records pre-cutover implementation acceptance, including **fork-era** layout
and leak-suite evidence, not transferred mainline qualification. The physical background-Push
checklist below records signed-candidate evidence separately. Specialized triage and delayed-tap
qualification remains pending the next stable campaign; implementation and development runs alone
do not qualify it. The [release ledger](RELEASE_STATUS.md) is authoritative.

- [x] Whole-mode queue, FIFO `Up next`, boolean fallback, whole-row actions, and no manual Refresh.
- [x] Seven exact notification states; permission only after explicit enable.
- [x] Per-device Private/Session/Preview sheet with default, warning, footnote, and disable action.
- [x] Strict v2 attention/clear payloads; per-instance replacement; exact-request clear; app badge.
- [x] Notification tap scrubs and revalidates the exact ask before the no-store Control launch.
- [x] Last-known metadata survives phone, tailnet, desktop, and relay failures with distinct copy.
- [x] The measured 411×816 Pixel layout viewport and synthetic 390×844 browser checks remain overflow-free with targets at least 44px.
- [x] Capability-leak scan and focused protocol, registry, HTTP, app, worker, and browser tests pass.

### Physical background-Push acceptance

Run the [dedicated Android Push procedure](ANDROID.md#physical-background-push-lane) against the
candidate gateway's exact Serve origin. An ordinary Chrome tab and a WebAPK for another gateway
do not satisfy admission. All observations below must be backed by the physical device; portable
fake-runtime tests cover failure/cleanup behavior but cannot check these boxes.
The operator turns DND off for the window; the lane only observes DND. Owned OS record keys and
post times separate real-session alerts from the fixture. One unowned overlap permits one recorded
phase re-arm, never an undisclosed retry; ambiguous ownership and repeated interference fail closed.
Permission must be granted before admission. The negative phase holds its origin-scoped CDP denial
connection open without a page, because disconnecting it removes Chrome's override. The driver
rewarms Chrome before releasing that connection, then verifies the restored preference and fresh delivery.

- [x] Closed WebAPK task: Private, Session, and Preview delivery with exactly one owned notification.
- [x] Lock-screen UI matches the selected detail and does not contain ask/prompt/answer canaries.
- [x] Attention tap: scrubbed route, current request/generation validation, writable Control.
- [x] Known busy across two polls → idle: stop notification tap is read-only View.
- [x] Same instance N → N+1: old stop tap is scrubbed/expired with zero launch requests.
- [x] Authoritative clear removes the exact ask; a fresh request remains visible across repeated current samples.
- [x] Force-stop observed variant plus a fresh post-relaunch delivery.
- [x] Permission-denied suppression and a fresh delivery after restoration.
- [x] Lock/resume and forced-Doze observed variant, without asserting guaranteed delivery.
- [x] Actual Wi-Fi → cellular → Airplane → restored-tailnet behavior.
- [x] Seven browser sinks plus notification title/body/data, URL/history, DOM, and resource timings
  are proven detectable and clean; macOS service streams are observed discarded.
- [x] Original subscription/detail/permission, radios, battery/Doze, task, and display/keyguard
  state restored; owned fixture stopped. No screenshots, notification content, or XML persisted.

The qualifying campaign of every stable release since v0.6.0 passed the twelve checks above
through its `androidPush` lane. Failed earlier attempts are recorded in the ledger. The latest is
[v0.7.1](RELEASE_STATUS.md#mainline-v071--published-stable), on the Pixel 10 Pro,
Android 17 build `CP3A.260905.009`, Chrome `154.0.8037.57`. The lane's detail, attention-tap,
activity-stop, stale-generation, clear, force-stop, permission, lock/resume, network, Doze,
forbidden-sink, and restoration phases map to these checks. The campaign rows record delivery,
tap/clear behavior, observed force-stop/Doze variants, ten detectable clean sinks, and restored
device/browser/fixture state. This evidence does not qualify the new specialized checks below or
guarantee background delivery.

### Specialized triage and delayed-tap acceptance — qualification pending

The implemented `triage_verified` and `stale_taps_verified` phases run after `clear_verified`
and before `force_stop_verified`. They qualify only when the next stable campaign passes on its
exact signed candidate. On 2026-10-01, a development run of the whole lane passed every phase,
these two included, with no re-arm, and restored the phone. It ran against the installed v0.7.1
gateway with stock OMP 18.4.8 fixtures on the Pixel 10 Pro, Android 17, Chrome `154.0.8037.57`.
That is tested evidence ([ANDROID.md](ANDROID.md#physical-background-push-lane)), so the boxes
below stay unchecked.
The lane owns a second fixture host. Before triage, no other session in the installed app's
directory may be waiting for input or hidden: order, Hold, and Show all act on the whole
device-local directory. The phase fails closed when this precondition is not met.

- [ ] Two fixture asks appear in arrival order (FIFO).
- [ ] Hold for desk on the oldest advances only this device's queue.
- [ ] Only the held ask's notification closes; the other ask's notification remains.
- [ ] Held asks remain in `N waiting · M held`; the gateway still reports both asks.
- [ ] Requeue restores arrival order.
- [ ] Holding both shows `Queue clear · N on hold`, not all-clear.
- [ ] Replacing one exact request releases only its stale hold.
- [ ] Hide an idle row, then Undo within five seconds restores it.
- [ ] Hide again and let Undo expire; the row stays hidden and `Live · N` still counts it.
- [ ] Later attention immediately restores the hidden row.
- [ ] Show all restores hidden rows.
- [ ] Triage actions, including Undo expiry, send no non-GET request to the gateway.
- [ ] A delayed tap after desktop resolution is rejected.
- [ ] A delayed tap after re-arming with a newer request on the same generation is rejected.
- [ ] A delayed tap after replacement by a new generation with its own request is rejected.
- [ ] A delayed tap after the host is gone is rejected.
- [ ] Each delayed tap scrubs its route before any API request, fetches metadata, makes zero
  launch requests, and shows the expired/changed notice.
- [ ] Cleanup stops both hosts, closes both topics' notifications, and waits for the app to drop
  both hosts' device-local Hold/Hide records.

Authoritative clear removes the original attention notification. The delayed-tap phase therefore
**re-presents the original notification's own metadata-only data** through the app's service-worker
registration, then taps it from the physical Pixel's lock screen. Evidence records `replayed: true`.
This proves delayed-tap handling on that device, not Web Push delivery ordering or delivery delay.

### Historical development observations — 2026-09-25

These observations predate the passed stable campaigns above and retain their original limits.
The 2026-09-25 development probes against v0.5.3 prove the stock-18.3.0 fixture transitions,
closed-task delivery and lock-screen detail at all three levels, full-sequence attention Control,
known-busy-to-idle View, same-instance stale rejection, clear/fresh retention, force-stop observed
delivery with fresh post-relaunch delivery, denied-permission suppression/restoration, and
digest-bound notification cleanup. The full sequence repeatedly timed out on lock/resume clear.
The smallest observed failing combined prefix was stale-generation → clear/fresh → force-stop,
failing its first post-relaunch clear. Instrumented repetitions received the exact current clear
and removed both browser and OS records; they did not establish the uninstrumented failure's cause.
Three repetitions with both page and worker DevTools detached through force-stop/relaunch/clear
also passed (0 failures in 3), with native enqueue-before-cancel ordering and unchanged delivery
targets. The absence of FCM receipt logs does not establish receipt ordering. On this Chrome
version, browser notification handles do not acknowledge native Android display; a silent
replacement followed immediately by close is therefore not a proven orphan repair.
An independent same-tag native-API probe then left orphans in 5/5 warm pairs and 0/5 cold-relaunch
pairs, despite zero browser handles after every close. Every warm replacement was enqueued after
native cancellation and remained visible to the OS observer about 15.8 seconds later. This proves
an API/native ordering failure, not its causal connection to the earlier full-sequence failure;
the worker now mitigates recent show/clear races with a 2,000 ms in-memory settle window,
an exact-request re-query before close, and duplicate-content replay suppression. This measured
budget is not an Android display fence or a qualification pass; old notices and notices
inherited by a fresh worker close immediately.
A detached native-API probe with that settle/re-query ordering then completed 10 warm and 5 cold
pairs with zero orphans. All pairs returned zero browser handles and remained natively absent
for at least 13.726 s after completion; fixture, transient UI, and device baseline were restored.
That controlled result does not substitute for the full Web Push checklist above.
Producer-first cleanup is enforced, but native-only orphan restoration was a separate explicit
experiment and is not credited as an authoritative-clear pass. Doze, the complete real network
matrix, and the final real sink sweep were then unproved end to end. These are **tested evidence**,
not qualification. See ANDROID.md for timings, restored
baselines, and the exact observed platform combination.

A later single uninterrupted run through the production adapter/runner against the retained Mac
and the development worker containing that mitigation again failed lock/resume authoritative
clear, after completing every phase through denied-permission restoration. It took 901.483 s
including cleanup; Doze, networking, and sinks were not reached. The final owned-topic native
enqueue preceded cancellation by 90.689 s with no later enqueue, unlike the controlled warm
replacement signature. FCM receipt, handler execution, and the lingering request/content identity
were not captured, so the cause remains unresolved. All ten device baseline booleans matched in
a post-run read-only check, the owned notification was absent, and the lease was released.
The original local-origin WebAPK remained installed after authorized retained-origin setup.
The mitigation is not a full-sequence fix and this run does not check the qualification boxes.

The cause was FCM's collapsible-message throttle. Every push carried a per-instance Web Push
`Topic`, which FCM limits to a burst of 20 messages per device, then one every three minutes. In a
controlled comparison on the same Pixel and origin, with byte-identical workers, transitions 1–21
stayed prompt with the `Topic`, and transitions 22 and 23 took 150.8 s and 172.4 s. Without it,
immediately afterwards, 28 of 28 arrived within 3.1 s. #255 sends pushes without a `Topic`
(ADR-017 amendment). [ANDROID.md](ANDROID.md) records the builds and a separate keyguard race
fixed in the lane's notification-tap helper.

With the no-Topic gateway, one uninterrupted development run on 2026-09-25 then completed every
original background-Push phase, including lock/resume, Doze, the Wi-Fi/cellular/Airplane matrix,
and the ten-sink
sweep, and its cleanup restored the phone. It first needed a lane fix for the Pixel's September
keyguard; [ANDROID.md](ANDROID.md) records both attempts. That run is tested evidence; the boxes
were subsequently checked by the stable campaigns, not by that development run.
