# Compatibility and support policy

## Private flosrn fork evidence

The Cloudflare Access/HarnessOS fleet variant in this fork is separate from the upstream release
matrix below. Upstream Tailscale and physical-device qualification does not qualify this variant.
The intended always-on host is gapicore and origin is `https://omp.ofmchat.ai`; a declared unit,
tunnel, source pin or secret render is not proof of deployment readiness.

**Tested — local Chrome mobile-viewport smoke:** the directory showed 10 live Mac sessions,
one gapicore session and one netcup-vie session. Directory load was 162 ms; gapicore Control's
composer became ready in 4,678 ms; reload resumed that same session in 4,877 ms. The saved
selection contained only `version`, `instanceId`, `generation`, `mode`; explicit Back removed it.
The smoke reported `capabilityInStorageOrDom=false` and `errors=[]`.

These are individual local observations, not latency guarantees or a release qualification.
They do not prove actual iPhone/Safari, Home Screen, background Web Push, production Access,
tunnel readiness, Hako coexistence or direct/proxy reachability. No real iPhone or live Web Push
proof is claimed for this variant.

**Tested — activity directory and workspace panel (ADR-034), 2026-10-03, unreleased candidate:**

- Automated: after the last review fixes (bridge auth-error mapping and the uncertain-write
  guard), the full Gateway runtime suite for apps and packages passed (789 tests, 0 failures,
  32 files, 5,180 expectations, 77 s), with type check of all four packages, the build, and 77
  targeted tests in 3 files (621 expectations). The release-build tests need a clean Git checkout,
  so the complete check ran after the commit: on commit `f236a41` the clean `bun run check`
  passed 1,331 tests with 4 skipped and none failing (77 files, 9,710 expectations, 97 s),
  including every type check, the build, and the repository, capability and identifier scans.
  Before that commit only test fixtures changed (synthetic home
  paths); the identifier leak scan then passed, with 173 tests in 4 files (975 expectations, 0
  failures). The final review delta (a refused Retry keeps a write uncertain; the update reload
  waits for pending or uncertain writes; manual sign-in reload confirms) passed type check and
  build, 20 workspace-controller unit tests (72 expectations) and 14 of 14 update e2e tests at both
  viewports. The later before/after-relay fixes (the `not-run` marker, pre-relay `401`/`403`
  envelopes, quick-reply double-tap guard, launcher and tab-loading fixes) passed 95 focused HTTP,
  panel, composer and transcript tests in 4 files (729 expectations); with the panel-close and
  switcher fixes, all four type checks and the build then passed, and the session-tools and update
  browser tests passed 22 of 22 at 390 and 411 px, including the update-reload receipt guard. HarnessOS: final type check passed; 153 tests in 6 files
  (640 expectations, including the generated contract) and the hub web suite (95 tests, 9 files)
  passed with the TypeScript/Vite build (existing 1.07 MB chunk warning). After the activity
  budget fix, the real-reader suite passed 16 tests (61 expectations), including a reader killed
  while the metadata lookup hangs, which keeps its saved scan progress. The full HarnessOS suite
  has no green run. A fifth attempt (`--parallel 4`, 30 s test timeout) hit its 900 s limit
  without reporting tests. Of the four earlier attempts, two hit the runner's time limit (300 s, and 600 s with
  `--parallel 1` and a 30 s test timeout); one showed a generated-schema failure, since fixed; one
  (`--parallel 4`) passed 1,540 tests and failed 18 across 90 files, all 5-second timeouts in
  suites this change does not touch (patch build, host bootstrap, secrets render, shell
  integration), cause not measured, so not cleared as unrelated. Run alone with a 30 s test
  timeout, the patch-build suite passed 45 tests (131 expectations, 109 s); this is not a full-suite
  run and does not measure the timeout cause. Run the same way, the shell-integration and
  secrets-render suites passed 31 tests (350 expectations, 21 s), and the host-bootstrap suite
  passed 23 (245 expectations, 14 s). On the settled runner source, the focused HarnessOS run
  passed 184 tests in 9 files (2,230 expectations, 37 s), including the runner's eight safety
  regressions (request deadlines, durable retired guards and the others), the 3 corrected Orca RPC
  real-transport fixtures and the 16 activity-boundary tests. After the HarnessOS merge with
  `main`, the root type check passed, the focused run passed 187 tests in 9 files (2,242
  expectations, 40 s), and the hub web suite passed 95 tests in 9 files (637 expectations) with
  its type check and build (the existing 1.08 MB chunk warning remains). Before deployment, the gapicore service check reported 17 services ok and none
  failing. A throwaway smoke of `FleetBridgeClient.workspace` against a real Bun HTTP server on a
  Unix socket: a write POST with the bearer got 200 and the exact request's receipt; a `text/html`
  reply and a JSON reply over 2 MiB were both rejected.
- Settled runner on a loopback Gateway (`localhost:4343`) against real machines: `inventory`
  answered 200 (26 projects, 21 terminals); `create` answered 200 and resending the same request
  id returned an identical receipt; `send` answered 200 at `input-accepted`, warning that delivery
  is unproven, and its same-id resend replayed; `set` answered 200 and the workspace then read
  `in-review`; `sleep` answered 200 sleeping; `close` answered 200 closed; `resume` answered 200
  and its same-id resend returned an identical receipt. After the `pi` fix, the Gateway
  transcript of an indexed `pi` root session answered 200 with 4 entries ending in
  `FINAL_SMOKE_OK`; `resume` of a `pi` root session in a new fixture answered 200 `accepted` after
  Orca's root-lookup probe, and `resume` of an advisor session answered `404 not-found`. A `send`
  to the resumed `pi` terminal answered 200 `input-accepted`, and the resumed root session's
  Gateway transcript then answered 200 with 4 entries whose agent replies were
  `ROOT_CREATE_FINAL_OK` and `ROOT_RESUME_FINAL_OK`: an agent turn ran after the resume.
- Pre-deployment baseline on netcup-vie, for comparison after deployment: 5 services ok and 2
  inactive (`conversation-engine` and `cloudflared-conversation-engine`, both outside this change
  and left as they are); the Docker chat-engine stack ran 14 of 14 containers, ingress and webhook
  included.
- Real data: the HarnessOS reader produced activity, context window and workspace for all 14 live
  sessions it read; cost became known for all 14 after repeated incremental scans (earlier passes
  correctly reported `null` while files were unread).
- Candidate on private loopback (`localhost:4339`, not the public origin): the directory rendered
  all 14 real sessions with previews, context meters, costs, subagent counts and workspace chips;
  no horizontal overflow at a 390 px viewport; grouping by Project and Machine, group collapse, and
  persistence across reload worked.
- Workspace RPC through the loopback Gateway against real machines: `inventory` answered 200 with
  26 projects, 45 workspaces, 21 terminals and 112 models, previews at most 240 characters.
  `search` on macbook (index on) returned 20 hits; on compute hosts with the index off it reported
  disabled with no hits. The panel at 390 px showed 20 real rows with no overflow and two
  correctly disabled controls. `set` answered 200 and the next inventory showed the new status and
  comment; `sleep` answered 200 and closed the workspace's terminals; `close` answered 200, the
  terminal list became empty and the worktree remained. `history` on macbook answered 200 for page
  1 and page 2, each 50 distinct sessions with a working cursor (an earlier run paged four distinct
  pages of 50 through the Gateway's parser), and `transcript` answered 200 with 164 entries.
- `create` from the 390 px panel with no explicit model (agent default) created the worktree
  `mobile-final-proof` with one agent terminal; the next inventory showed branch
  `feat/mobile-final-proof` and one connected, writable terminal. `send` to that terminal answered
  200 `accepted` at stage `input-accepted`, with a warning that delivery is unproven; resending the
  exact same body and request id answered 200 with an identical response. The saved transcript
  then held exactly four entries: the create prompt, `MOBILE_FINAL_OK`, the sent text and
  `MOBILE_REPLAY_OK`. So create and send started real turns in this fixture, and the duplicate
  request id added no third prompt or reply: the input was delivered once end to end.
- `resume`: an exact OMP session in the disposable `mobile-final-proof` worktree was found by
  search; its `transcript` answered 200 with 4 normalized entries. After `close` answered 200,
  `resume` answered 200 `accepted` in the same worktree with a new canonical terminal handle. This
  proves the resume terminal was launched, not that a turn started.
- Browser: the full e2e campaign on the final Gateway source passed 70 of 70 at 390 and 411 px
  viewports (all 6 e2e files, 65 s). An earlier focused run passed 8 of 8, including create with the
  model omitted versus an explicit model kept across a reordered catalog. A 1440 px desktop
  screenshot showed no horizontal overflow. In the built app in Chrome on loopback, with the
  session switcher open and focused, a streamed directory update left the first row the same
  element, still connected and still focused. The workspace panel opened as a real modal dialog
  (`:modal`); going back in history with it open swapped to the directory and closed it (neither
  open nor modal), reopening it was modal again, and nothing overflowed at 390 px.

**Tested — deployed public origin, 2026-10-03:** Gateway `a729c9b` and HarnessOS `cd57919`
served `https://omp.ofmchat.ai` through the existing owner-only Access app and dedicated tunnel.
The anonymous directory and workspace POST redirected to Access (302); authenticated inventories
for Mac, gapicore and netcup-vie returned 200. A disposable mobile-viewport Mac workspace used the
model picker to create an OMP terminal, then exercised metadata editing, send, sleep, saved history
and transcript, resume and close through the public broker, all with 200 receipts. DeepSeek's
token-plan quota refused its turns (429); a separate Grok fixture returned the actual assistant
markers for create, send and a post-resume prompt. Control joined the pinned client and reconnected
after reload. Mobile 390x844 and desktop 1365x768 showed no horizontal overflow; the persisted
selection contained only version, instanceId, generation and mode, and Back cleared it.
The old `omp.shipmate.bot` DNS route was removed; the earlier old-origin observations remain
historical, not an outstanding deployment target.
Both disposable worktrees, their terminals, the fixture's Orca setup/repository registration and
temporary directory were removed; subsequent listings contained no matching fixture.

**Not verified:** `transcript` and `resume` with the host's index actually disabled; Access
revocation on a real device; app badge and end-of-turn Push on iPhone; Hako and direct-network
qualification. Public browser checks used Chrome through the configured proxy, not a physical
iPhone. Nothing here is Supported or Qualified.

## Platforms and browsers

Use OMP Session Gateway from a modern browser, and install it as a PWA where the platform supports
web-app installation. The gateway runs on the computer that runs OMP.

| Surface | Status | Tested by | Qualified on hardware |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux host | Supported | `portable-source (ubuntu-24.04)`, `implementation-checks`, `linux-arm64-source-checkout` (aarch64), daily `canary` against stock OMP | Debian 13 (trixie) x86-64 |
| macOS host | Supported | `portable-source (macos-latest)` | macOS 26.6.1 arm64 (`Mac14,3`) |
| Windows host | Supported | `portable-source (windows-latest)`, `windows-service-lifecycle`, daily `canary-windows` against stock OMP | Windows Server 2025 x86-64, started at interactive logon, from an Administrator or a standard account |
| Chrome and Chromium | Supported | `browser-core` desktop Chromium; `browser-notifications` full suite at Pixel sizes | Chrome on Android 17, Pixel 10 Pro; Chrome on Android 16, a cloud Galaxy S26 |
| Edge and other Chromium-based browsers | Supported through Chromium | `browser-core` desktop Chromium; the client has no Edge-specific code path | None |
| Firefox | Supported | `browser-core` desktop Firefox | None |
| Safari and WebKit | Supported | `browser-core` desktop WebKit | Safari on iOS and iPadOS 26.6, a cloud iPhone 17 Pro Max and iPad (9th generation) |
| Android | Supported | `browser-notifications` at measured Pixel sizes | Pixel 10 Pro, Android 17, Chrome; a cloud Galaxy S26, Android 16, Chrome |
| iPhone and iPad | Tested as a browser | `browser-core` WebKit with iPhone-class emulation | iPhone 17 Pro Max, iOS 26.6, and iPad (9th generation), iPadOS 26.6, with Safari, on cloud devices (ADR-032) |

**Supported** means every listed lane stays green (on each change, the canaries daily) and bug
reports are accepted. **Qualified on hardware** names what a signed release passed on real
machines, in [Current claim](#current-claim) and the [release ledger](RELEASE_STATUS.md). Hosted
runners and browser engines are not physical devices, so neither column stands in for the other;
see the [status vocabulary](#status-vocabulary).

- **Installing as a PWA.** Chromium browsers install from the browser menu on desktop and Android.
  Safari installs with Add to Home Screen on iPhone and iPad, and Add to Dock on macOS. Desktop
  Firefox has no web-app install; it works in a tab.
- **Background alerts** (Web Push) are qualified in full only on the Pixel with Chrome on Android,
  where force-stop and forced Doze outcomes are observed variants, never guaranteed delivery. iPhone
  and iPad offer them only to a Home Screen app (iOS and iPadOS 16.4+); v0.6.0 and earlier cannot
  enable them there because WebKit omits a null `expirationTime` from the subscription (#274); the
  fix ships in v0.6.1. Playwright's WebKit has no push service, so the compatibility lane runs
  desktop WebKit without service workers and does not test WebKit push. From v0.6.2, a cloud iPhone
  also qualifies enabling alerts in the Home Screen app, delivery with the app in the background,
  and the tap into Control, but not lock-screen presentation (ADR-032).
- **Browser versions.** The client uses CSS `color-mix()`, `:has()`, and dynamic viewport units, so
  browsers older than roughly Chrome and Edge 111, Firefox 121, and Safari 16.2 render incorrectly.
- **Windows** starts the gateway at interactive logon, not at unattended boot.

## v0.5.0 compatibility correction

Published v0.4.2 rejects the additive `busy` field emitted by OMP 18.2.9 and can hide live sessions
(#219). The v0.5.0 parser fix accepts validated booleans and preserves absent/null as unknown.
Mixed current/legacy host discovery and View/Control are covered by real local IPC regression tests.
This does not advance the pinned baseline, native/client versions, or exact qualification matrix.

v0.5.0 stop alerts use the presence of valid activity metadata, not an OMP version guess.
Older hosts keep ordinary directory/ask behavior with unknown activity. Push state and v2
attention/clear remain compatible; older workers cannot interpret stops until activation and
the browser may substitute a generic background-update notification. Open or refresh the PWA
after upgrading before relying on stop alerts.
This does not qualify physical background delivery or imply successful task completion.

## Current claim

Stock mainline OMP `>= 18.1.20` is the supported host prerequisite for the current checkout.
Earlier releases are unsupported because this local registry does not exist in them.
[PR #11908](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11908), merge `4999b98bd5`, ships in
[v18.1.20](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/releases/tag/v18.1.20). Set `collab.autoStart`
only and start participating sessions with plain `omp`; no gateway-specific OMP build is required.
From v0.5.2 the gateway ignores fields OMP adds under registry v1 and validates only the fields it
reads (ADR-028); a registry version bump or a changed type for a field it reads still needs a
gateway change. The current checkout's engineering baseline is v18.4.8 (`UPSTREAM.lock.json`);
the qualified matrix below records the exact qualification of the release named next and changes
only when a candidate built from a newer baseline qualifies.

**Published stable:** [v0.7.1](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/releases/tag/v0.7.1),
GitHub Latest, promoted from v0.7.1-prealpha.1 with identical runtime bytes. Its published-byte
local/Pixel smoke passed on the first attempt against Bun's global stock OMP 18.1.20. v0.7.1 hands
a tapped notification to the open page instead of reloading it, releases a frozen session list's
live-update stream, and has the gateway release event streams that stop reading. Every lane passed
on its first attempt in one campaign. The [release ledger](RELEASE_STATUS.md) records the
qualification lanes and exact source/archive bindings; [upgrade and rollback](UPGRADE_ROLLBACK.md)
covers the rollback predecessor, v0.7.0.

Specialized attention and lifecycle (branch/resume) remain outside the qualified matrix below.
They are tested by the expanded `androidPush` triage/delayed-tap phases, upstream canary stages,
and retained-Mac `ompPublication` lifecycle runner. Development runs are tested evidence only;
the new scenarios qualify only from a passed stable campaign on its exact signed candidate.
See [attention acceptance](ATTENTION_SPEC.md) and
[lifecycle coverage and pending Windows CI](LIFECYCLE_BRANCH_RESUME.md).

| Surface | Current contract | Qualification |
|---|---|---|
| Mainline OMP host | `>= 18.1.20`; discovery/query v1 | Exact `18.4.2` publication, View/Control, stale-generation rejection, and revocation passed |
| Exact qualified source | `v18.4.2`, `4620bb8338e0ecace7ea237da9d5088d16068617` | Fresh signed-candidate evidence; no fork-era transfer |
| Gateway build/runtime | Bun `1.4.0` | Signed artifact and 46-file non-metadata runtime equivalence passed |
| Debian host | Debian 13 (trixie) x86-64 | Lifecycle, persistence, 83/83 migration/recovery invariants, and teardown passed |
| Mac host | macOS 26.6.1 arm64, `Mac14,3` | Doctor 18/18, rollback 23/23, rotation and reboot-to-login persistence passed |
| Windows host | Windows Server 2025 x86-64, build `26100`, started at interactive logon, from an Administrator or a standard (non-elevated) account | Upgrade from v0.7.0, real reboot and automatic logon start, doctor, named-pipe publication, Pixel View/Control, rotation, rollback, and uninstall passed on a disposable VM; a fresh install from a standard account, its token without `SeSecurityPrivilege`, then passed reboot, automatic start at that account's logon, doctor, rotation, and uninstall |
| Physical client | Pixel 10 Pro, Android 17 build `CP3A.260905.009`, Chrome `154.0.8037.57` | View/Control, same-page lock/Airplane/Doze recovery, seven detectable clean capability sinks |
| Background Web Push | Pixel 10 Pro, the installed OMP Sessions app closed | Delivery at each detail level on the lock screen, taps to current Control and View, stale-generation refusal, authoritative clear, permission revocation, and network changes passed; force-stop and Doze recorded as observed variants |
| Cloud browsers | iPhone 17 Pro Max, iOS 26.6, Safari 26.6; iPad (9th generation), iPadOS 26.6, Safari 26.6; Galaxy S26 (`SM-S942B`), Android 16, Chrome `145.0.7632.159`; TestingBot real devices | View/Control on the candidate's app bundle and seven detectable clean capability sinks on each; no vendor test record held a live link, video, or screenshot. Serve saw the workstation's allowlisted login, not a phone's |
| iPhone background alerts | The iPhone above, unlocked, its Home Screen app in the background | Alerts enabled with a real tap, delivery in 16.0 s through `web.push.apple.com`, and the tap into current Control with a scrubbed address; not lock-screen presentation |
| Remote access | TUN-mode Tailscale Serve, exact allowlist, Funnel disabled | Mac/Pixel allowed-user access, Debian tagged-user denial, direct backend refusal |
| Default OMP relay | Fresh 1,800-second check, two transitions, final phase live | Eight-hour endurance not rerun or claimed |

The gateway only reads OMP discovery, polls metadata, and fetches capabilities per launch without
storing them. The minimum version is an integration contract, not proof that every later release
or platform has been tested. No fork-era qualification, signed receipt, or endurance result
transfers to this architecture. Current source/package pins live in `UPSTREAM.lock.json`.

Every mainline release so far renewed a founder-approved fresh 30-minute signed-candidate relay
check in place of the eight-hour gate; the release ledger records each window. Other release gates
remain intact.
Eight-hour endurance is not rerun or claimed;
prolonged-operation risk remains an accepted limitation rather than transferred historical proof.

The Linux ARM64 source-checkout job stages the published platform native package at the
`UPSTREAM.lock.json` version
and runs upstream's `registry.test.ts`, `registry-smoke.test.ts`, and `host-registry.test.ts`.
It gates only the discovery/query contract consumed by the gateway, not unrelated upstream
collaboration suites or full repository checks. The required Windows job gates gateway contracts,
ACLs, and service lifecycle only. In [run 34818847249](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/actions/runs/34818847249),
native staging succeeded, but upstream's graceful SIGTERM fixture received exit 143 rather than
0, followed by a Bun 1.4.0 crash during registry tests. Real OMP-to-gateway discovery on Windows
is exercised by the `canary-windows` lane, which drives stock OMP's named pipe through the
unchanged reader, and each stable campaign's signed-artifact Windows lane qualifies Windows Server
2025 x86-64 at interactive logon ([WINDOWS_QUALIFICATION.md](WINDOWS_QUALIFICATION.md), ADR-031).

## Fork-era published-release history

Everything in this section records the named historical gateway artifacts, not current source.
Their patch prerequisites and activation commands apply only to their matching release tags.

**Published qualified stable:** `v0.3.0` (immutable GitHub Latest), exact patched OMP `v18.1.14`, Bun `1.4.0`.<br>
**Signed candidate:** `v0.3.0-prealpha.3`, independently qualified and approved.<br>
**Rollback predecessor:** published stable `v0.2.1`, retaining its own exact patched OMP v17.4.1.<br>
**Advertised combinations:** Debian 13 (trixie) x86-64 and macOS 26.6.1 arm64 (`Mac14,3`) hosts,
with Chrome `152.0.7977.75` on Android 17 (Pixel 10 Pro). Nothing else is advertised.

Fresh signed-artifact provenance, Debian/macOS/Pixel qualification, 49-file runtime equivalence,
and 28,800-second default-relay endurance passed. Historical qualification does not transfer.

Tailscale Serve over tailnet HTTPS is the only supported remote path. Funnel must remain disabled
and Tailscale must run its TUN-mode client; userspace-networking tailscaled does not establish the
required loopback/identity boundary and is refused
([#98](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/issues/98)). Stable v0.3.0 requires
OMP v18.1.14 at `daf07999c2fee9b22edc7bf8fea1fb6272e0df5e`, patched tree
`17f84676442ee103564d01755ed1f76bbc51820e`, and the versioned `omp-gateway-patched` activation
route. Stock OMP is unsupported. Older releases retain the immutable baselines recorded below.
Upstreaming and paired packaging are not gates for this exact matrix under ADR-024 and ADR-025.

The stable support claim comes from one exact signed-candidate qualification, not row counts or
transferred labels. Candidate `v0.3.0-prealpha.3` at source
`2c89d8280059a2bb638901d413df44b35593ddd4` passed the complete matrix through one resumable
receipt:

- release run [`34254684458`](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/actions/runs/34254684458)
  verified the signed tag, six assets, checksums, three GitHub attestations, three Sigstore bundles,
  and archive SHA-256 `05c8a8f4001612d7e10c52139bf5b7aa53dca42e64fa2c262592cf6c4d932ec5`;
- Debian run [`34258230589`](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/actions/runs/34258230589)
  passed the complete disposable Debian 13 lifecycle and the published `v0.2.1` predecessor pair;
- `Mac14,3` / macOS 26.6.1 arm64 passed `doctor` 17/17, rollback 20/20 against published `v0.2.1`,
  persistence, exact artifact checks, patched-OMP publication/revocation, uninstall, and cleanup;
- the physical Pixel passed same-page lock, Airplane, and forced-Doze recovery with a clean
  seven-sink capability sweep after explicit ADB authorization;
- exact patched OMP v18.1.14 published and revoked generation-1 View and Control with `200 no-store`;
- the default relay finished a 60-second smoke and a fresh 28,800-second endurance run live; and
- final cleanup measured zero gateway/OMP processes and zero gateway listeners.

Windows source/lifecycle checks pass, but Windows remains unadvertised and outside this stable
matrix. No prior release evidence substitutes for a v0.3.0 candidate lane. Supplemental physical
camera delivery on Chrome `152.0.7977.82` and endurance on `Mac16,5` / macOS 26.6.2 are named
smokes/scenarios, not additional supported host/browser combinations.

Known limits remain part of the claim. Exact candidate `v0.3.0-prealpha.3` recovered same-page automatically
after the qualified lock, Airplane, and forced-Doze transitions. Chrome for Android can still wedge
its process-wide network state after some abrupt transitions while Android remains healthy. Native
EventSource reconnection and the bounded snapshot fallback recover the proven cases; after 45
uninterrupted visible seconds the loaded shell exposes force-stop/reopen help. JavaScript does not
claim it can restart Chrome's network service
([#65](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/issues/65)). Preview detail currently falls
back to Session detail. Background Web Push remains outside the stable core claim. Portal Tunnel,
self-hosted/proxied relays, Funnel, userspace networking, shared mutually untrusted local accounts,
and every unnamed platform/browser/version remain unsupported.

A signed artifact proves origin, not fitness. Candidate history for the 0.1 point release is
explicit, and the 0.2 campaign adds its own row:

| Candidate | Build | Disposition | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `v0.1.0-prealpha.18` | `0.1.0-3a9bb1cccc6e` | **Failed qualification; retained as evidence.** Repeated explicit rollback reached systemd's start-rate limit and repair could not restart. | Six signed/attested assets verified; macOS/Pixel/relay sublanes passed; Debian full lane failed at W2. |
| `v0.1.0-prealpha.19` | `0.1.0-28d89a99565d` | **Qualified replacement.** Clears the systemd start-rate counter only before an explicit operator-requested install/rollback start. | Archive SHA-256 `f6e01c4b96b5630fccbb3c79f0a0dae1677e316990d869db6e300ce96605a762`; checksums, three GitHub attestations, and three Cosign bundles verified; exact Debian/macOS/Pixel evidence above. |

[`RELEASE_STATUS.md`](RELEASE_STATUS.md) is the source of truth for evidence and release decisions.
This document defines the supported boundary. Where they disagree, the ledger is authoritative.

## Status vocabulary

Compatibility statements use these terms deliberately:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Tested** | A named CI lane runs it and is green, on every change or on its stated schedule. It proves that lane's scope on hosted runners or browser engines, not a physical device or a signed release. |
| **Supported** | A platform family the project keeps working and accepts bug reports against. Each supported family names the Tested lanes that cover it and its known limits; support never implies qualification. |
| **Qualified** | The complete applicable release matrix passed on the named version, OS, browser, and deployment path. |
| **Implemented** | The relevant code path exists and has repository-level automated coverage. |
| **Smoke-tested** | A named scenario passed in one recorded environment. This is not a platform support claim. |
| **Deferred** | Intentionally outside the current release target. |
| **Unsupported** | Must not be presented as a working deployment path. |

An implemented or smoke-tested row remains unqualified until every applicable security,
installation, lifecycle, and cleanup scenario passes. Blank version ranges never imply support.
Tested and supported never become qualified: a green hosted or emulated lane is not a
physical-device or signed-release result. A family whose lanes stop running loses its support
status (ADR-030).

Real-device cloud rows (ADR-032) are qualified **in the browser on a cloud device**: the stable
campaign's `deviceCloud` lane passed on the named real device, OS, and browser version in
TestingBot's cloud, each as the device itself reported it. The limits are part of that claim.
Tailscale Serve saw the orchestrator's allowlisted login, not the phone's own; alerts were proven
with the device unlocked and the app in the background; and lock, Airplane, Doze, force-stop, and
cellular behavior are qualified only on the Pixel.

## Exact OMP baseline

**Fork-era evidence:** the table and pin-refresh records below are immutable published-release
history, not the mainline support matrix above. Any local patch path or lock reference here means
the file at that historical tag; it no longer describes the shipping prerequisite.

Published releases and unreleased development targets use separate immutable upstream revisions:

| Gateway line | OMP source | Nearest release baseline | OMP package baselines | Collab client | Registry protocol | Claim |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `0.3.0`, qualified stable v0.3.0 | `can1357/oh-my-pi@daf07999c2fee9b22edc7bf8fea1fb6272e0df5e` | `v18.1.14` | coding-agent `18.1.14`; wire `18.1.14` | collab-web `16.3.6` from the same source commit, with gateway patches | 1 | Fresh signed v0.3.0-prealpha.3 matrix and endurance; exact patched tree `17f84676442ee103564d01755ed1f76bbc51820e` |
| `0.3.0`, published as `v0.3.0-prealpha.2` | `can1357/oh-my-pi@9350b7990d26ebf69a604edc82d8558ef04adf30` | `v17.4.1` | coding-agent `17.4.1`; wire `17.4.1` | collab-web `16.3.6` from the same source commit, with photo composer patches | 1 | Published engineering prerelease; exact local smoke only |
| `0.1.0`, published as `v0.1.0-alpha.1` | `can1357/oh-my-pi@858f7dd91fff9b84cf8a2c6a6bb85aa0e6d03a55` | `v17.3.8` | coding-agent `17.3.8`; wire `17.3.8` | collab-web `16.3.6` from the same source commit | 1 | Exact-commit alpha qualification only |
| `0.1.0`, published as `v0.1.0-beta.1` | `can1357/oh-my-pi@9350b7990d26ebf69a604edc82d8558ef04adf30` | `v17.4.1` | coding-agent `17.4.1`; wire `17.4.1` | collab-web `16.3.6` from the same source commit | 1 | Exact-commit beta qualification through the versioned patched-binary route |
| `0.1.0`, published as `v0.1.0` | `can1357/oh-my-pi@9350b7990d26ebf69a604edc82d8558ef04adf30` | `v17.4.1` | coding-agent `17.4.1`; wire `17.4.1` | collab-web `16.3.6` from the same source commit | 1 | Exact-commit stable qualification with patch tree `a5cfc80fcc0df1ca6e430c125371bcae43d5e5f7` through the versioned patched-binary route |
| `0.2.0`, published as `v0.2.0` | `can1357/oh-my-pi@9350b7990d26ebf69a604edc82d8558ef04adf30` | `v17.4.1` | coding-agent `17.4.1`; wire `17.4.1` | collab-web `16.3.6` from the same source commit | 1 | Exact-commit stable qualification with patch tree `a5cfc80fcc0df1ca6e430c125371bcae43d5e5f7` through the versioned patched-binary route |
| `0.2.1`, published as `v0.2.1` | `can1357/oh-my-pi@9350b7990d26ebf69a604edc82d8558ef04adf30` | `v17.4.1` | coding-agent `17.4.1`; wire `17.4.1` | collab-web `16.3.6` from the same source commit | 1 | Exact-commit stable qualification with unchanged patch tree `a5cfc80fcc0df1ca6e430c125371bcae43d5e5f7`; UI/version point release only |

v17.3.8 remains the immutable alpha baseline; the older beta and stable lines retain exact v17.4.1.
Stable v0.3.0 independently qualifies the exact patched v18.1.14 pin in `UPSTREAM.lock.json`.
No loose semver range, stock binary, or arbitrary fork is supported.

**Pin refreshed 2026-08-21, from `v17.3.8` to `v17.4.1`.** The maintained
`gateway-collaboration` series already targeted the new exact base. The carried health-probe commit
applied cleanly, and the v17.4.1 QR-command fixture was adapted to exercise manual publication
recovery. Upstream collab-web, wire, and relay host/client implementation bytes are unchanged;
package metadata and the out-of-path session-close ordering changed. Earlier platform evidence did
not transfer automatically: `.20` repeated the beta lanes, and stable candidate `.23` repeated the
complete signed-artifact, Debian, macOS, physical Pixel, exact patched-OMP publication/revocation,
relay, leak, and cleanup gates. The command-complete `omp-gateway-patched` route is the qualified
stable prerequisite; upstreaming and paired OMP packaging remain non-gates.

**Pin refreshed 2026-08-19, from `v17.0.6` / `89d6a8f6d14286f32f09ec9c8aa8af7b3451d2d6`.** The
previous mbox did not apply at this commit (`interactive-mode.ts`, `agent-session.ts`,
`session-manager.ts`, and `builtin-registry.ts` all conflicted), so the shipped patch was
regenerated against `v17.3.8`. The refresh itself carried source-level evidence only: it re-ran the
documented patch suite and the repository suite, and it re-ran no native host, Tailscale, relay,
Android, browser, or signed-artifact qualification. Any platform row whose evidence predates
2026-08-19 is therefore **NOT RUN** for this pin until re-executed, and an unchanged row is never
coverage of `v17.3.8`.

Historical v0.2.1 qualification used candidate `v0.2.1-prealpha.2`. On 2026-08-28 it passed the
complete Debian signed-artifact lifecycle including the published `v0.2.0` predecessor
migration; the complete macOS install, persistence, rollback, and cleanup sequence; exact v17.4.1
patched-OMP publication/revocation; physical Pixel same-page lock, Airplane, and forced-Doze
recovery; the seven-sink capability sweep; and the bounded relay smoke. The protected
28,800-second long-window result transferred within that unchanged historical relay/client/wire
baseline only; it does not transfer to v0.3.0. The current candidate repeated endurance independently.
Issue #65 stays open for other process-wide Chrome failures, not as a
qualification exception for the transitions the candidate actually passed.

The fork-era source paths, versions, observation dates, and upstream findings remain in each
release tag’s `UPSTREAM.lock.json`. Those historical integrations required:

- the apply-ready OMP controller/auto-start/registry patch in
  [the fork-era patch directory](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/tree/v0.3.0/patches/oh-my-pi);
- the pinned collab-web source integration described by
  [`packages/collab-client/upstream/UPSTREAM.json`](../packages/collab-client/upstream/UPSTREAM.json);
- the reviewed in-memory client bootstrap, because upstream collab-web writes a
  capability to `location.hash`; and
- exact Bun `1.4.0` for the v0.3.0 qualified build/runtime. Archives declare Bun `>=1.4.0`, but
  no broader version range is qualified. Historical v0.2.1 remains specific to Bun `1.3.14`.

## Versioned interfaces

Three compatibility surfaces change independently:

| Surface | Current version | Current behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway client of OMP discovery/query | 1, mainline OMP `>= 18.1.20` | Strict discovery and reply validation; snapshot polling and per-launch link resolution. |
| PWA to gateway HTTP API | `/api/v1` | Metadata-only list/SSE; generation-bound launch plus `409 mode_unavailable`. |
| Pinned OMP browser client | Exact source/provenance in the client lock | In-memory bootstrap; not a claim to support arbitrary client/wire combinations. |

There is no gateway-owned publisher protocol and no cross-version publisher fallback. Unknown
protocol majors fail closed. The host minimum does not supersede the pinned browser-client
provenance or the need for exact release qualification.

## Host and client matrix

**Fork-era evidence only:** every result and support label in this historical matrix belongs to
the named patched-OMP artifacts. It does not qualify the mainline prerequisite.

The following describes code, evidence, and each row's support boundary. Debian 13 x86-64, macOS
26.6.1 arm64, and Chrome 152.0.7977.75 on the Android 17 Pixel have exact `v0.3.0-prealpha.3`
qualification. Historical evidence never substitutes for this result.
Windows passes persistent source acceptance through reboot-to-interactive-login and the complete
gateway/OMP path, but remains unadvertised until signed Windows gateway and patched-OMP artifacts
repeat it. This Windows-only gap does not block the narrower stable matrix. Desktop Chromium is
smoke only.

| Platform | Implemented path | Recorded evidence | Qualification | Support claim |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linux host | User-only Unix-domain socket; systemd user service | Signed `v0.3.0-prealpha.3` passed the complete Debian 13 x86-64 lifecycle in [run 34258230589](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/actions/runs/34258230589): install/readiness, permissions, rotation, diagnostics, v0.2.1 upgrade/rollback, identity denial, persistence, refusal-safe uninstall, cleanup, and disposable-host teardown. Exact patched OMP v18.1.14 built and published. | Qualified with TUN-mode Tailscale Serve; no other Linux release, architecture, or init-system claim. | Stable v0.3.0: Debian 13 x86-64 only |
| macOS host | User-only Unix-domain socket; LaunchAgent | Signed `v0.3.0-prealpha.3` on Mac14,3 / macOS 26.6.1 arm64 passed exact archive/native-addon checks, private install, doctor 17/17, rotation/persistence, control-plane restart, v0.2.1 rollback 20/20, identity/exposure, exact patched OMP v18.1.14 build/publication/revocation, uninstall, Serve reset, and zero-process/listener cleanup. | Qualified only for macOS 26.6.1 arm64 on Mac14,3 with TUN-mode Tailscale Serve; interactive-login startup. | Stable v0.3.0: named macOS combination only |
| Windows host | Current-user named pipe and Scheduled Task with `LogonTrigger` + `InteractiveToken`; paired OMP publisher uses nonce-bound mutual HMAC before releasing capabilities | Hosted run `29791906104` passed publisher mutual authentication, ACLs, cross-user denial, service lifecycle, rotation, and uninstall. A persistent Windows Server 2025 source lane on 2026-08-21 then passed exact-source install in 77,498 ms, reboot with task installed but no pre-login listener, automatic first-RDP-login startup without `/Run`, config/token continuity, rotation, active upgrade, history-selected rollback, TUN-mode Serve, `doctor` 17/17, and clean uninstall. Exact patched OMP `v17.4.1` built on the host, auto-published View and Control, returned `200 no-store` launches, denied a mismatched generation `409`, and revoked within 374 ms after forced exit. | **PARTIAL for release.** The persistent source lane accepts #90 and the reboot/login contract, but its gateway archive and OMP binary were unsigned. A Windows-only hang in the complete `read-only.test.ts` fixture also remains to be dispositioned; the publisher suite passed 13/13 and production publication/revocation passed. Repeat the entire lane with paired signed artifacts. | None; Windows remains unadvertised. If later promoted, the promise is “starts at interactive login,” not unattended boot. |
| Android client | Installable HTTPS PWA through Tailscale Serve | Pixel 10 Pro / Android 17 build CP2A.260805.005 / Chrome 152.0.7977.75 loaded signed candidate asset `/assets/app.32115375c6b5.js`. View/read-only, Control, and prompt acknowledgement passed. Same-page lock (9,451 ms), Airplane (8,481 ms), and forced Doze (8,799 ms) recovered without a reload; all seven forbidden capability sinks were detectable and clean. | Qualified only for the named device/OS/browser. Issue #65 remains a process-wide Chrome limitation outside the proven transitions. | Stable v0.3.0: named Pixel combination only |
| Desktop Chromium | Development/smoke client | Serve access as the current node's allowed identity, loopback-backend identity rejection, three real OMP cards, View/Control/interrupt, SSE, URL scrub, browser-store/cache checks, process removal, foreground/online reconnect, and live `/new` generation revocation (`409` for the stale generation) passed | Not a release target, and never a substitute for physical Android qualification: emulating a device's viewport and pixel ratio is not a result from that device. The denied-identity evidence in this document comes from a tagged droplet and the physical Pixel, not from desktop Chromium. | Smoke only |

At those fork-era releases, no other Linux init system, macOS deployment mode, Windows service
mechanism, iOS browser, Firefox, Safari, or Chromium derivative had a compatibility claim. Current
platform and browser support is in [Platforms and browsers](#platforms-and-browsers).

The v1 HTTP identity boundary assumes a user-controlled workstation. Any untrusted process or
different OS account that can connect to the desktop's loopback port can forge the non-cryptographic
Serve identity headers and is therefore outside the support boundary. Shared shell hosts and
mutually untrusted local accounts are unsupported even though IPC publication itself remains
current-user/token protected.

## Deployment dependency matrix

**Fork-era evidence only:** measured results below retain their original scope. The current
Tailscale-only policy is unchanged, but the mainline candidate must repeat qualification; even
unchanged browser or relay behavior does not inherit these passes.

| Dependency or mode | Current state | Compatibility statement |
|---|---|---|
| Tailscale Serve over tailnet HTTPS | Required production architecture. Advertised evidence includes macOS-hosted Serve on macOS 26.5.2/26.6.1 arm64; supplemental Windows Server 2025 source acceptance used Authenticode-valid Tailscale `1.102.3`, TUN mode, and passed `doctor` 17/17. No Tailscale version range is qualified. | The signed-candidate identity matrix is closed for the advertised hosts: tagged/no-user identity denied, real non-allowlisted identity denied, real allowlisted identity admitted, forged headers ignored, direct backend addresses refused, and Funnel disabled. Windows repeats only the allowed self-node/Serve half in unsigned source acceptance and therefore gains no support claim. Direct loopback spoofing remains outside the explicitly single-user v1 trust boundary, and the full identity evidence must repeat on every newly advertised host. |
| User-owned Tailscale source identity | Designed identity-header mode | One exact user-owned login — the operator's own — was observed through Serve and allowlisted for qualification; no broader identity or device support is claimed. The login itself is deliberately not reproduced here: the only login written into this file is a placeholder in a reserved TLD, so nothing readable here is ever authenticable. A denial by a *different real person's* login has never been measured and cannot be produced by a single-account tailnet. |
| Tagged Tailscale source device | Unsupported, and now measured | Serve populates user identity headers only for user-owned source devices, so a request proxied from a tagged source arrives with no user identity and the `tailscale-serve` auth mode must fail closed. Measured on droplet a node carrying `tag:omp-session-gateway`, confirmed by both `tailscale status` and `tailscale whois`, which reported no user profile and a tag list: `403` through Serve on `/api/v1/sessions` and on `/`. A tagged phone would need a separately designed app-capabilities or equivalent authentication mode; do not silently weaken authentication to accommodate one. |
| Any other forwarder onto the gateway's loopback port | Unsupported; a complete authentication bypass | A tunnel, reverse proxy, port forward, container publish, or SSH `-L` that terminates remote traffic and relays it to `127.0.0.1:<port>` presents a loopback peer, satisfying the first authorization check, and then forwards whatever `Tailscale-User-Login` the remote caller chose. Tailscale Serve is safe here only because it overwrites caller-supplied identity headers; nothing else in this design does. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) §4 and [#74](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/issues/74). |
| Existing OMP encrypted relay | Required v1 relay path. Real View/Control/interrupt passed. Exact stable candidate `.23` finished a 60-second default-relay smoke live with two transitions. A protected 28,800-second run completed 22 transitions without restart; it transfers because relay host/client, collab-web, and wire bytes are identical. Relay availability and traffic metadata remain inherited dependencies. | Supported only through the existing default relay; no availability or metadata-hiding guarantee beyond OMP's relay |
| Self-hosted or proxied relay | Unsupported/deferred | Must pass the dedicated long-lived WebSocket soak and a separate security qualification before it can be documented as supported. |
| `dev-localhost` HTTP mode | Development only | Never a remote, LAN, or production deployment path. |
| Tailscale Funnel or public reverse tunnel | Unsupported | Must not be enabled or documented as a normal deployment path. |

WebAuthn control gating, a Trusted Web Activity, native Android applications, and multi-host
federation remain deferred. Background Web Push is qualified on the Pixel by each stable
campaign's background-Push lane (ADR-031): the exact-version closed-app, lock-screen,
tap-to-current-Control, stale-generation, force-stop, network-change, Doze, and forbidden-sink
matrix, with force-stop and Doze recorded as observed variants. From v0.6.2, the real-device cloud
lane (ADR-032) adds a narrower iPhone check: Home Screen install, alerts enabled with a real tap,
delivery with the app in the background, and the tap into Control. Other browsers and devices
remain unqualified for background alerts.

## Upstream refresh procedure

For every proposed OMP update:

1. Inspect the new release/tag and collaboration-related source changes.
2. Update `UPSTREAM.lock.json` with the exact tag, commit, package versions, Bun version,
   relevant paths, findings, and observation date.
3. Check the supported mainline discovery/query contract and minimum host version; do not create a
   downstream OMP patch or fallback transport.
4. Rebuild the pinned collab-web integration and verify its provenance and license notices.
5. Run discovery/query, protocol, link parsing, View, and Control verification.
6. Run the [upstream canary](LIFECYCLE_BRANCH_RESUME.md#daily-upstream-canary): `publish`,
   `snapshot`, `stale-generation`, `view`, `control`, `new-generation`, `fork`, `branch-rewind`,
   `continue`, and `unregister`. Windows runs `continue` but skips exactly the three keystroke
   stages. Prove the retained-Mac `ompPublication` lifecycle step with
   `bun scripts/omp-lifecycle-development.ts --omp <absolute path to stock OMP dist/cli.js>`
   before the campaign; require its additive lifecycle evidence in that campaign. Keep
   relay-replacement, fatal-failure, and shutdown checks; these stages do not stand in for them.
7. Run the complete capability-leak suite and real browser/Android acceptance.
8. Qualify every advertised host installer and deployment path.
9. Update this matrix, [`RELEASE_STATUS.md`](RELEASE_STATUS.md), and the changelog.

Do not call an additional OMP version or platform qualified merely because it satisfies the
`>= 18.1.20` minimum; record exact CI and acceptance evidence for each advertised combination.

## Protocol evolution

- Reject unknown major protocol versions.
- Add optional fields within a major only when old peers safely ignore them.
- Never reinterpret a field's security meaning in place.
- Emit one browser API major at a time.
- Record protocol versions in diagnostics without capability values.
- Document upgrade order and rollback behavior when the gateway and mainline host contract changes.

Every published release must identify the exact OMP and collab-web source, build command,
Bun version, dependency lockfile hash, local patches, license notices, and shipped asset hashes.
