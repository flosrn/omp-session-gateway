# Security policy

## Project status

OMP Session Gateway v0.4.0 is the current qualified stable release and works with stock OMP
`>= 18.1.20` through its native discovery/query contract. No OMP fork or custom build is required. Use only the exact host/client/deployment combinations advertised in [`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md); do not expose the loopback backend directly, enable Tailscale Funnel, use Portal Tunnel or another forwarder, or treat an unqualified platform or background Web Push as supported.

The private flosrn fork additionally defines a Cloudflare Access/fleet variant; it is not covered
by upstream artifact qualification. Use its explicit `cloudflare-access` authenticator, never a
tunnel into `tailscale-serve`, and verify the private gateway-only bridge/process isolation before
deployment. See [the fork boundary and revocation limits](docs/SECURITY.md#private-flosrn-access-and-fleet-boundary)
and [fork evidence](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md#private-flosrn-fork-evidence). Access revoke does not
terminate an already-open OMP collaboration connection.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately through this repository's [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/security/advisories/new). Do not open a public issue containing:

- collaboration links or URL fragments;
- OMP discovery/query tokens, gateway readiness tokens, or legacy publisher tokens;
- transcript content;
- Tailscale identity details;
- filesystem paths that reveal private project names; or
- exploit steps that would put current users at immediate risk.

If GitHub Security Advisories is unavailable, contact `@alphastorm` through a private channel listed on the maintainer's GitHub profile.

## What to include

Include the affected version/commit, deployment mode, impact, minimal reproduction, and whether any bearer capability or transcript data may have been exposed. Redact all live secrets and use synthetic fixtures.

## Response expectations

The volunteer-maintainer response targets are:

- acknowledge within 3 business days;
- provide an initial severity assessment within 7 business days; and
- coordinate disclosure after a fix or mitigation is available.

These are goals, not a service-level guarantee for a volunteer project.

## Security design

The detailed threat model, trust boundaries, and release gates are in [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md). Changes to authentication, capability handling, IPC, browser storage, logging, or OMP lifecycle must update that document and include security-focused tests.

## Supported versions

Use the [current stable release](https://github.com/alphastorm/omp-session-gateway/releases/latest).
The [compatibility policy](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) defines the exact supported host/client/deployment
matrix; the [release ledger](docs/RELEASE_STATUS.md) records its evidence and known limitations.
The minimum OMP version is not qualification of every later version or platform.

Older releases retain their own historical prerequisites. In particular, v0.3.0 is a fork-era
migration/rollback predecessor, not the current recommended install; crossing that boundary
requires the [stopped recovery procedure](docs/UPGRADE_ROLLBACK.md), and gateway rollback does not
switch OMP. Please report suspected vulnerabilities in any version privately.
